    <h1 id="migration-notice">MIGRATION NOTICE</h1>
    <p>
      Random rants filestore has migrated to supabase because of the free
      limitations on google&#39;s firebase storage. This is so there is no
      cutoff on random rant&#39;s filestore&#39;s uploading during the
      transition from googles appspot storage, but all files have been kept on
      the original bucket from the server because of this migration. You
      won&#39;t be able to find your old files any more and there is a file
      count limit as well. (you can only upload 18 files before the server
      resets its counter and all new files uploaded will overwrite the old ones
      and require new keys) New enviroment variables required are on the bottom
      of this readme.

      Random Rants - File Storage Server
    </h1>
    <p>This is where Random Rants stores user media and other user content.</p>
    <h2 id="upload-api-v1-disabled-by-default">
      Upload API (V1) [Disabled by default]
    </h2>
    <p>A file is stored on the server using a POST request.</p>
    <p>
      Send the request to <code>/uploadfile</code> with the body being something
      like
      <code
        >{ &quot;data&quot;: &quot;(base64 here)&quot;, &quot;contentType&quot;:
        &quot;text/plain&quot; }</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        ><strong
          >It can overload the server if the request is large enough.</strong
        ></em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Response will be like:
      <code
        >{ &quot;id&quot;: &quot;123&quot;, &quot;key&quot;: &quot;abc123&quot;
        }</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>Only use this to upload small files now.</p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >NOTICE: This version of the API is deprecated and no longer enabled on
        the server by default.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <h2 id="upload-api-v2">Upload API (V2)</h2>
    <p>
      This is made with the FormData API in mind, also to allow loading larger
      files. One file can be sent per request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Send the request to <code>/uploadfilev2</code> to upload, make sure its
      POST as well.
    </p>
    <p>Responds same as API V1.</p>
    <h2 id="upload-limitations">Upload Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      One file can be uploaded at once, if multiple then it would be paused
      until the other file is uploaded. This is to prevent possible interference
      with other files. Not an intentional limitation.
    </p>
    <h2 id="download-api">Download API</h2>
    <p>
      Once the server responds with the right response JSON, you can request
      like <code>/file/123/abc123</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>123</code> being the id, and <code>abc123</code> being the key. Note
      this is not a real file, a real file request would have the key be random
      numbers and letters and the ID whatever the files number in the storage
      is.
